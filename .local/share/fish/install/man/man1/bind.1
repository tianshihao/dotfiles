.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBbind\fP manages key bindings.
.sp
If both \fBKEYS\fP and \fBCOMMAND\fP are given, \fBbind\fP adds (or replaces) a binding in \fBMODE\fP\&.
If only \fBKEYS\fP is given, any existing binding in the given \fBMODE\fP will be printed.
.sp
\fBKEYS\fP is a comma\-separated list of key names.
Modifier keys can be specified by prefixing a key name with a combination of \fBctrl\-\fP, \fBalt\-\fP, \fBshift\-\fP and \fBsuper\-\fP (i.e. the \(dqwindows\(dq or \(dqcommand\(dq key).
For example, pressing \fBw\fP while holding the Alt modifier is written as \fBalt\-w\fP\&.
Key names are case\-sensitive; for example \fBalt\-W\fP is the same as \fBalt\-shift\-w\fP\&.
\fBctrl\-x,ctrl\-e\fP would mean pressing \fBctrl\-x\fP followed by \fBctrl\-e\fP\&.
.sp
Some keys have names, usually because they don\(aqt have an obvious printable character representation.
They are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
the arrow keys \fBup\fP, \fBdown\fP, \fBleft\fP and \fBright\fP,
.IP \(bu 2
\fBbackspace\fP,
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcomma\fP (\fB,\fP),
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdelete\fP,
.IP \(bu 2
\fBend\fP,
.IP \(bu 2
\fBenter\fP,
.IP \(bu 2
\fBescape\fP,
.IP \(bu 2
\fBf1\fP through \fBf12\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBhome\fP,
.IP \(bu 2
\fBinsert\fP,
.IP \(bu 2
\fBminus\fP (\fB\-\fP),
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpageup\fP,
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpagedown\fP,
.IP \(bu 2
\fBspace\fP and
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtab\fP,
.UNINDENT
.sp
These names are case\-sensitive.
.sp
An empty value (\fB\(aq\(aq\fP) for \fBKEYS\fP designates the generic binding that will be used if nothing else matches. For most bind modes, it makes sense to bind this to the \fBself\-insert\fP function (i.e. \fBbind \(aq\(aq self\-insert\fP). This will insert any keystrokes that have no bindings otherwise. Non\-printable characters are ignored by the editor, so this will not result in control sequences being inserted.
.sp
To find the name of a key combination you can use \fI\%fish_key_reader\fP\&.
.sp
\fBCOMMAND\fP can be any fish command, but it can also be one of a set of special input functions. These include functions for moving the cursor, operating on the kill\-ring, performing tab completion, etc. Use \fBbind \-\-function\-names\fP or \fI\%see below\fP for a list of these input functions.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If a script changes the commandline, it should finish by calling the \fBrepaint\fP special input function.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If no \fBKEYS\fP argument is provided, all bindings (in the given \fBMODE\fP) are printed. If \fBKEYS\fP is provided but no \fBCOMMAND\fP, just the binding matching that sequence is printed.
.sp
Key bindings may use \(dqmodes\(dq, which mimics vi\(aqs modal input behavior. The default mode is \(dqdefault\(dq. Every key binding applies to a single mode; you can specify which one with \fB\-M MODE\fP\&. If the key binding should change the mode, you can specify the new mode with \fB\-m NEW_MODE\fP\&. The mode can be viewed and changed via the \fB$fish_bind_mode\fP variable. If you want to change the mode from inside a fish function, use \fBset fish_bind_mode MODE\fP\&.
.sp
To save custom key bindings, put the \fBbind\fP statements into \fI\%config.fish\fP\&. Alternatively, fish also automatically executes a function called \fBfish_user_key_bindings\fP if it exists.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
The following options are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-f\fP or \fB\-\-function\-names\fP
Display a list of available input functions
.TP
\fB\-L\fP or \fB\-\-list\-modes\fP
Display a list of defined bind modes
.TP
\fB\-M MODE\fP or \fB\-\-mode\fP \fIMODE\fP
Specify a bind mode that the bind is used in. Defaults to \(dqdefault\(dq
.TP
\fB\-m NEW_MODE\fP or \fB\-\-sets\-mode\fP \fINEW_MODE\fP
Change the current mode to \fINEW_MODE\fP after this binding is executed
.TP
\fB\-e\fP or \fB\-\-erase\fP
Erase the binding with the given sequence and mode instead of defining a new one.
Multiple sequences can be specified with this flag.
Specifying \fB\-a\fP or \fB\-\-all\fP with \fB\-M\fP or \fB\-\-mode\fP erases all binds in the given mode regardless of sequence.
Specifying \fB\-a\fP or \fB\-\-all\fP without \fB\-M\fP or \fB\-\-mode\fP erases all binds in all modes regardless of sequence.
.TP
\fB\-a\fP or \fB\-\-all\fP
See \fB\-\-erase\fP
.TP
\fB\-\-preset\fP and \fB\-\-user\fP
Specify if bind should operate on user or preset bindings.
User bindings take precedence over preset bindings when fish looks up mappings.
By default, all \fBbind\fP invocations work on the \(dquser\(dq level except for listing, which will show both levels.
All invocations except for inserting new bindings can operate on both levels at the same time (if both \fB\-\-preset\fP and \fB\-\-user\fP are given).
\fB\-\-preset\fP should only be used in full binding sets (like when working on \fBfish_vi_key_bindings\fP).
.TP
\fB\-s\fP or \fB\-\-silent\fP
Silences some of the error messages, including for unknown key names and unbound sequences.
.TP
\fB\-k KEY_NAME\fP or \fB\-\-key KEY_NAME\fP
This looks up KEY_NAME in terminfo and binds that sequence instead of a key that fish would decode.
To view a list of the terminfo keys fish knows about, use \fBbind \-\-key\-names\fP or \fBbind \-K\fP\&.
This is deprecated and provided for compatibility with older fish versions. You should bind the keys directly.
Instead of \fBbind \-k sright\fP use \fBbind shift\-right\fP, instead of \fBbind \-k nul\fP use \fBbind ctrl\-space\fP and so on.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP or \fB\-\-help\fP
Displays help about using this command.

otherwise, jump to the next occurrence of \fIany right\fP bracket after the cursor.
The following brackets are considered: \fB([{}])\fP
.TP
.B \fBjump\-till\-matching\-bracket\fP
the same as \fBjump\-to\-matching\-bracket\fP but offset cursor to the right for left bracket, and offset cursor to the left for right bracket.

reexecutes the prompt functions and redraws the prompt (also \fBforce\-repaint\fP for backwards\-compatibility)
.TP
.B \fBrepaint\-mode\fP
reexecutes the \fI\%fish_mode_prompt\fP and redraws the prompt. This is useful for vi mode. If no \fBfish_mode_prompt\fP exists or it prints nothing, it acts like a normal repaint.

.SH TERMINAL LIMITATIONS
.sp
Unix terminals, like the ones fish operates in, are at heart 70s technology. They have some limitations that applications running inside them can\(aqt workaround.
.sp
For instance, historically the control key modifies a character by setting the top three bits to 0. This means:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Many characters + control are indistinguishable from other keys: \fBctrl\-i\fP \fIis\fP \fBtab\fP, \fBctrl\-j\fP \fIis\fP newline (\fB\en\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Control and shift don\(aqt work simultaneously \- \fBctrl\-X\fP is the same as \fBctrl\-x\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Other keys don\(aqt have a direct encoding, and are sent as escape sequences. For example \fBright\fP (\fB→\fP) usually sends \fB\ee\e[C\fP\&.
.sp
Some modern terminals support newer encodings for keys, that allow distinguishing more characters and modifiers, and fish enables as many of these as it can, automatically.
.sp
When in doubt, run \fI\%fish_key_reader \- explore what characters keyboard keys send\fP\&. If that tells you that pressing \fBctrl\-i\fP sends tab, your terminal does not support these better encodings, and so fish is limited to what it sends.
.SH KEY TIMEOUT
.sp
When you\(aqve bound a sequence of multiple characters, there is always the possibility that fish has only seen a part of it, and then it needs to disambiguate between the full sequence and part of it.
.sp
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
bind j,k \(aqcommandline \-i foo\(aq
# or \(gabind jk\(ga
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will bind the sequence \fBjk\fP to insert \(dqfoo\(dq into the commandline. When you\(aqve only pressed \(dqj\(dq, fish doesn\(aqt know if it should insert the \(dqj\(dq (because of the default self\-insert), or wait for the \(dqk\(dq.
.sp
You can enable a timeout for this, by setting the \fI\%fish_sequence_key_delay_ms\fP variable to the timeout in milliseconds. If the timeout elapses, fish will no longer wait for the sequence to be completed, and do what it can with the characters it already has.
.sp
The escape key is a special case, because it can be used standalone as a real key or as part of a longer escape sequence, like function or arrow keys. Holding alt and something else also typically sends escape, for example holding alt+a will send an escape character and then an \(dqa\(dq. So the escape character has its own timeout configured with \fI\%fish_escape_delay_ms\fP\&.
.sp
See also \fI\%Key sequences\fP\&.
